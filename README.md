A mod for [OneConfig](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfig) that allows you to customize the hit color of any living entity to your liking.

## Features

- An option to toggle Armor being affected.

- An option to make all individual options be controlled by "Option Behavior":
    - Individual (Default): Edit each entity hit color individually.
    - Global: Allows you to edit each entity hit color with the global settings category.
    - Both: Same thing as Global, but when an individual option is changed, that option overrides the global option automatically.


- An option to edit each entity hit color individually and globally:
  - An option to toggle the hit color being affected by brightness.
  - The ability apply a certain animation to entities when hit.
  - An option to customize the hit color itself.

### Entities are grouped based on three things:
- The dimension they reside in (Hostile only).
- Whether they are passive or not.
- How rare they are to find.
